# MindSpace

## Welcome to MindSpace, the mental health web app that helps you find peace of mind, one space at a time.

## About

MindSpace is a web app that aims to improve access to mental health resources and support, particularly for those who may not have the means or ability to attend in-person appointments. The app includes functionality for mental health resources such as support groups, therapy options, and crisis hotlines.
## Future Plans

In the future, we plan to integrate with wearable devices to track physical activity and sleep patterns, provide a personalized dashboard to track mental health progress and set goals, and offer real-time chat or video conferencing with mental health professionals. We also plan to add a notification system for medication reminders and appointment scheduling.
